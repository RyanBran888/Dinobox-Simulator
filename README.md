My Game for High-Seas

I spent a lot of time making this project and hope you enjoy, all of the songs are made by me, and all of the art is from hackclub, canva free, and members of the slack!

if you can't download then i guesssss you can watch my demo video which is not fell made, becuase i want people ot actually play the game
